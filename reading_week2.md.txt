** Q1: Steady flow in channel **

Imagine steady water flow down a rectangular channel that is 1-m wide.
For specificity, assume the water is 1 m deep.

    Imagine dye is injected in the channel at four spots across the channel and sketch what the dye would trace out in time.
    If there is no friction, and the water doesn’t accelerate or decelerate, how much energy is need to keep it moving?
    If there is friction, and the flow is still steady (i.e. the friction doesn’t stop it), what force might be causing the water to keep moving down- channel?

If there is no friction, and the water doesn't accelerate or decelerate, the energy needed to keep the water moving is mgh. 
If there is friction, and the flow is still steady, there may be a pressure gradient force causing the water to keep moving down channel (higher pressure upstream, lower pressure downstream).

** Q2: Widening channel **

Imagine the channel (gradually) widens to 2-m wide, but the flow remains steady (in time); again assume no friction:

    sketch what the dye streaks might look like as the channel widens. Why did you choose these paths?
    if you sketched your dye streaks properly, what do you thinks is conserved between them?
    Assuming there is no friction, what forces are in the fluid that act to change the flow speed?

The dye should follow the motion of the water as the channel widens, which will diverge to fill the new width of the channel. 
Momentum, energy, mass should be conserved in the sketches.
Assuming there is no friction, pressure gradient forces will act to change the flow speed.

** Q3: Flow around a cylinder **

Now imagine a very wide channel and a small cylinder placed in the flow so that it looks like a circle from above; again assume steady flow and no friction:

    sketch how equally spaced dye streaks placed far upstream of the cylinder will deform around the cylinder.
    what forces cause the deformation.
    change co-ordinate systems for a minute, and imagine the cylinder being pulled through the water. What is the net rate of work (F*u) necessary to pull it through the water?

![Q2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BfIuoayKV0rN_cbMV_Ct7-y7Ev38zMkR/view?usp=sharing)

Deformation is caused by forces in the direction of the fluid flow and perpendicular to the flow (stresses). 
F*u  = p*A*u
