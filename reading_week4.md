** Q1: Why do wave crests move froward? **

  Sketch the orbitals in a surface wave after Figure 7.6, but include an orbital at the top crest of the wave, and one at the trough. Do the convergences and divergences make the wave crest move forward? How do you get waves going in the negative x direction using the same logic?

The convergences and divergences make the wave crest move forward through the piling up and spreading out of water in the convergence/divergence zones. 
The same logic can be used to describe waves moving in the negative x direction, by changing the direction of the orbitals below the crests and troughts. 

** Q2: Dispersion relation: **

  Use a graphics package to quickly plot up the dispersion relation (7.40). Indicate where the deep-water and shallow-water asymptotes are on your plot, and sketch (by hand if you like) the dispersion relations at the asymptotes.

** Q3: Energetics of Waves **

  Why is 7.56 the only term in the energy equation for surface waves? (see notes from week 2/3 about energy equationsâ€¦)
  
7.65 is the only term in the energy equation for surface waves because the total energy id equally divided between the potential and kinetic energies.
