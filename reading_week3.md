** Q1: Meaning of vorticity **
Solid-body rotation is what we learned about in high-school. What is the relationship between ω
and the rate of angular rotation dθ/dt?

  ω and the rate of angular rotation are the same, and is a measure of the change in angular displacement per unit time.
 
 ** Q2: Conservation of vorticity **
Consider the vorticity equation:
Dω/Dt=(ω⋅∇)u+ν∇2ω

Now assume that ν is very small (frictionless), ω is only in the vertical direction, and that ∂u/∂z=∂v/∂z=0, and that ∂w/∂z>0. 
Show Dω/Dt>0 if ω>0 (obvious), and more importantly argue why from the principles you learned in high-school physics.

  Dω/Dt = (ω⋅(∂u/∂z+∂v/∂z,∂w/∂z)) = ω (∂w/∂z) > 0 if w>0 and dw/dz>0. 
  If ω>0, and ∂w/∂z>0, if we were to follow a parcel moving in the +ve z direction, the velocity would increase with time as it increases in z due to the condition that (∂w/∂z) > 0.
  
** Q3: Kelvin’s Circulation Theorem **
Prove to yourself that the Circulation theorem works for both a solid-body vortex and for an irrotational vortex.

  Circulation theorem works for both a solid-body vortex and irrotational vortex because it is a measure of the conservation of circulation around a closed curve, and moves with the fluid, so the type of vortex shouldn't matter as long as there are conservative body forces.
