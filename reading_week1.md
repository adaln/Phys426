**Q1: What does density (tend) to depend on?**
Consider the density of fresh water or dry air. What two thermodynamic variables does the density of the fluid depend on, and in what sense?

Density depends on temperature and pressure. In general, lower temperatures have higher densities, and higher temperatures have lower densities. Pressure affects the density of gases more than liquids due to it's lower the low compressibility of liquids. Density generally increases with pressure.

**Q2: What _is_ pressure?**
Briefly explain what pressure is in terms of molecular motion. If we put a surface in the fluid what effect does the pressure have on the surface? Why doesnâ€™t pressure have a direction?

Pressure is the force per unit area applied over a surface; the force of the molecules in a surface hitting the boundary of the surface. If you put a surface in a fluid the fluid will exert a force on the surface proportional to the size of the surface. Pressure acts in all directions perpendicular to the surface (no direction).

**Q3: How does pressure support water columns?**
Suppose we have a U-shaped pipe with a constant cross-sectional area of 0.1m^2. Water filled up to 1 m above the bottom of the U. A weight of 10 kg is placed on a plunger on one side of the pipe. What will the water levels be in each side of the pipe?

mg/A + dg(h+dh) = dg(h-dh); h = 1m, dh = change in water level, d = density of water (1000kg/m^3), g = acceleration due to gravity (9.81m/s^2), m = 10kg.
Solving for dh, dh=0.05m. On the side with the weight, the water level will be 0.95m, while the other side will be 1.05m.

**Q4: Kinematics: How does "advection" change the Eulerian perception of a quantity?**
Suppose the concentration of Caffeine in a river is measured to be 100 g/m^3 at one station, and 150 g/m^3 at a station 100 km upstream. if the river is flowing downstream at 1 m/s, what do you think the concentration will be at the downstream station three hours later?

dC/dt = -u dC/dx, where u = 1 m/s, dC/dx = (100-150)g/m^3 / 100000m = -0.005 g/m^4, dt = 10800s

(Cf-Ci)/dt = (Cf - 100g/m^3) / 10800s = -1m/s (-0.0005 g/m^4)

Cf = 105.4g/m^3
